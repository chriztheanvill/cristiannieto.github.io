## 🎯 Design Patterns Used

I've applied the following patterns in real-world projects:

- ✅ **Singleton**: For managing global state safely.
- ✅ **Factory Method**: For object creation abstraction.
- ✅ **Builder**: For constructing complex objects step-by-step.
- ✅ **Strategy**: To switch algorithms at runtime.
- ✅ **Observer**: For event-driven architectures.
- ✅ **Command**: For undo-redo functionality.

## 👥 Teamwork

Most of my work has been done in teams ranging from **3 to 7 developers**, collaborating through:

- Code reviews
- Agile sprints (Scrum)
- Git-based workflows (feature branches, PRs)
- Shared documentation and architecture diagrams
