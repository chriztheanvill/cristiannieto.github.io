## üßæ Work Experience

### Mediterranean Shipping Company ‚Äì *Data Systems Developer*  
**Mexico DF, Mexico | Internal**  
**February 2017 ‚Äì December 2018**

During my two-year tenure at MSC, I was involved in the development and maintenance of internal tools used by finance and administrative teams to manage large-scale shipping data. The role required a deep understanding of database systems, front-end interfaces, and backend logic, while also ensuring performance and security across environments.

---

### üîß Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Backend:** PHP (Vanilla), C++, Node.js (for final project)
- **Databases:** MySQL (Development), SQL Server (Production)
- **Tools:** FileZilla, SAP Integration APIs, JSON for data exchange

---

### üìå Key Projects & Responsibilities:

#### 1. **Internal GUI Development using PHP Vanilla**

- Developed user-friendly graphical interfaces for accountants and administrators to interact with financial and operational data.
- Built read-only dashboards for database visualization, allowing non-technical users to extract insights without direct access to raw tables.
- Ensured clean separation between business logic and presentation layers for maintainability.

#### 2. **MySQL Database Development**

- Designed and maintained relational databases for internal systems.
- Implemented **triggers**, **indexes**, and **foreign key constraints** to ensure data integrity and improve query performance.
- Created and updated tables based on evolving business requirements.
- Wrote complex queries to aggregate and analyze shipping and billing data.

#### 3. **File Management via FTP (FileZilla)**

- Regularly retrieved and uploaded critical system files using FileZilla.
- Debugged and fixed corrupted or misconfigured files before deployment to production servers.

#### 4. **C++ Mini-Projects**

- Developed lightweight C++ applications to automate querying thousands of records from databases.
- Implemented serialization and deserialization techniques to store and retrieve object states efficiently.
- These programs were used internally for batch processing and report generation.

#### 5. **SAP Invoice Automation**
- Built scripts to generate invoices programmatically and send them directly to SAP systems using integration protocols.
- Reduced manual entry errors and improved invoice turnaround time significantly.

#### 6. **Final Project: Node.js Migration**
- Led the transition of legacy PHP scripts into a more scalable Node.js environment.
- Integrated RESTful APIs and improved response times through asynchronous processing.
- Enhanced data handling using modern JavaScript practices and better error handling.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions:

#### Challenge: Legacy Codebase
- Much of the existing code was written in vanilla PHP without any framework, making scalability and debugging difficult.

**Solution:**  
Refactored code progressively, introduced modular structures, and documented processes to ease future development.

#### Challenge: Performance Bottlenecks in MySQL
- As datasets grew, queries became slower, especially when aggregating large volumes of shipping data.

**Solution:**  
Optimized queries, added proper indexing, and restructured schema design using normalization and denormalization where appropriate.

#### Challenge: Data Synchronization Across Environments
- Differences between MySQL (development) and SQL Server (production) caused inconsistencies during deployment.

**Solution:**  
Created migration scripts and validation checks to ensure compatibility and consistency between both platforms.

### üìÖ Reason for Leaving:
The decision to leave was due to the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic** on global operations and restructuring within the company. It provided an opportunity to explore new technologies and expand my professional horizons.

---

### üí° Highlights:
- Strong full-stack experience with emphasis on backend and database development.
- Proven ability to work in high-pressure environments and deliver robust solutions.
- Familiarity with enterprise-level systems like SAP and production-grade databases such as SQL Server.
