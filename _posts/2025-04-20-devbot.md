### **Game Development**  

**Role:** [C++ Developer, Game Programmer]  
**Duration:** 1.6 years | **Team Size:** 4  
**Technologies:** Unreal Engine, C++17, Blueprints  
**Projects:** American Football Simulation, Action RPG  

---

### **Projects Developed**

#### **1. American Football Game**

- **Genre:** Sports Simulation
- **Platform:** PC
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
- **Role:** Core Gameplay Programmer / Systems Designer

**Overview:**  
This prototype aimed to recreate the intensity of American football with dynamic player AI, physics-based tackles, and real-time play calling. The game featured a simplified NFL-style gameplay loop with replays and commentary integration.

**Key Features:**

- Realistic physics interactions using PhysX
- Play-by-play commentary system
- Dynamic camera system for replays
- Networked multiplayer support (LAN)

**Technologies Used:**

- C++17 for gameplay systems and networking
- Niagara particle system for visual effects
- Control Rig and Animation Blueprints for character movement
- Unreal Multi-User Networking (UMG UI + Replication)

---

#### **2. Action RPG**

- **Genre:** Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG)
- **Platform:** PC
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
- **Role:** Combat System Lead / AI Behavior Designer

**Overview:**  
A stylized fantasy ARPG featuring fast-paced combat, skill trees, and procedurally generated dungeons. The game focused on responsive controls, enemy AI behavior trees, and a modular inventory system.

**Key Features:**

- Modular character build system
- State-machine based combat system
- Procedural dungeon generation using noise maps
- Dialogue system with branching choices

**Technologies Used:**

- Gameplay Ability System (GAS) in Unreal Engine
- Behavior Trees & Blackboard for AI logic
- Data Tables for weapon and ability management
- MetaHuman framework for character creation

## **Challenges & Solutions | Technical Summary**

### **Technical Achievements & Challenges**

Working with only four people over 1.6 years presented several challenges, especially when balancing feature development with engine complexity and performance constraints. Below are some of the major challenges we faced and how we solved them:

---

#### **Challenge 1: Performance Optimization in Unreal Engine**

**Issue:**  
As both projects grew in complexity, frame rate dropped significantly due to heavy use of physics and animation blueprints.

**Solution:**

- Optimized Blueprint usage by moving critical systems into C++
- Implemented object pooling for projectiles and AI actors
- Reduced draw calls through material merging and LODs
- Profiling with Unrealâ€™s built-in tools like GPU Visualizer and Stat Commands

---

#### **Challenge 2: Synchronization in Multiplayer (Football)**

**Issue:**  
Desync issues occurred during networked plays due to input latency and inconsistent replication.

**Solution:**

- Built a custom prediction and reconciliation system
- Used Unreal's NetCodeQoS plugin for packet loss mitigation
- Rewrote movement component to handle server-authoritative updates
- Added lag compensation for hit detection

---

#### **Challenge 3: AI Behavior Complexity (RPG)**

**Issue:**  
Enemy behaviors became too complex to manage in Blueprints alone, leading to spaghetti logic and bugs.

**Solution:**

- Refactored all AI logic into Behavior Trees using C++
- Created reusable task and decorator classes
- Implemented event-driven perception system (sight/hearing)
- Used EQS (Environment Query System) for smart enemy pathing

---

### **Tools & Processes We Used**

- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub repositories
- **Task Management:** Trello + Notion for sprint planning
- **Build Pipeline:** CI/CD via GitHub Actions for nightly builds
- **Testing:** Automated unit tests using UE's Automation System
- **Documentation:** In-engine documentation using Doxygen-style comments

---

### **Lessons Learned**

- Unreal Engine is powerful but requires discipline in architecture and code quality.
- Early prototyping saves time in the long run.
- Collaboration tools and version control are essential for remote work.
- A big PC

---

### **Conclusion**

It was a proving ground for our skills in game development, software engineering, and teamwork. Through trial and error, we gained deep knowledge of Unreal Engine, C++ programming, and game systems design. These experiences have shaped us into stronger developers capable of tackling large-scale projects in professional environments.
