## **Project Overview & Company Summary**

### **Company Overview ‚Äì Actinver**
Actinver is a leading Mexican financial institution and a key player in the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV). It provides services in brokerage, investment banking, asset management, and proprietary trading. During my time there, I was contracted by Citi to work on a high-performance trading platform project based in their WeWork tower office in Mexico City.

I was part of a small but highly skilled team of only three developers, where we were responsible for building a custom low-latency trading system from the ground up. The project lasted for two years and involved developing both backend and UI components using modern technologies while exploring alternatives like Rust and Zig for performance-critical modules.

### **Project Summary**

**Role:** C++ Developer | **Team Size:** 4 | **Duration:** 1 Years  
**Technologies:** C++20, Qt, Qwt6, CMake 

---

### **Technical Stack & Development Approach**

- **C++20**: Primary language for system development. Leveraged modern features such as concepts, ranges, and coroutines for clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- **Build System**:  
  - **CMake** for cross-platform builds
  - **vcpkg** for dependency management across multiple libraries
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Poco C++ Libraries** for networking, threading, and utilities
- **Development Environment**:
  - Linux containers for consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment
- **Performance Analysis:**:
  - Profiling done with tools like `perf`, `Valgrind`, and `gprof` to identify bottlenecks and optimize latency-critical code

---

#### **Exploratory Languages: Zig & Rust**
As part of our research phase, we evaluated **Zig** and **Rust** as alternatives for certain components:

- **Zig:** Explored for its simplicity and zero-cost abstractions; considered for lightweight utilities but not adopted due to ecosystem maturity.
- **Rust:** Evaluated for memory safety and concurrency features; promising for future projects, but ultimately not chosen due to team expertise and tight deadlines.

These experiments helped us understand trade-offs between modern languages and legacy performance needs.

### üé® **User Interface Development**

#### **Qt / QML**
- Built **Order Management Systems (OMS)** interfaces using **Qt/QML**, enabling traders to interact with complex financial instruments in real time.
- Key advantages:
  - Native look and feel across platforms.
  - Efficient multithreading capabilities for background data processing.
  - Seamless integration with C++ backend engines for low-latency updates.
- Developed real-time **order book visualization screens**, where market depth and trade activity were rendered dynamically based on streaming data from exchanges.

#### **WPF + .NET**
- Developed internal tools and reporting dashboards using **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** and **.NET Framework**.
- Focused on non-latency-sensitive applications such as compliance reports, audit logs, and user analytics.
- WPF provided rich UI capabilities with data binding, templates, and styling, ideal for internal-facing applications with complex visualizations.

#### **Bootstrap**
- Integrated **Bootstrap** into web-based dashboards and admin panels used for configuration and monitoring.
- Ensured responsive layouts and cross-browser compatibility for internal stakeholders accessing tools through browsers.

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database & Backend Services**
- Used **Firebase Realtime Database** for lightweight, real-time synchronization of user preferences, session states, and small-scale datasets.
- Firebase was particularly useful for rapid prototyping and MVPs where scalability wasn't the primary concern.

## **Challenges & Solutions**

| Challenge                                      | Solution                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-frequency data updates in UI**          | Optimized Qt/QML event loop and implemented worker threads using `QThread` and `QtConcurrent` to avoid blocking the main thread.                                           |
| **Latency-sensitive order execution**          | Profiled and optimized key functions using `perf` and `callgrind`. Reduced critical path latencies by ~40% through memory layout improvements and reduced lock contention. |
| **Cross-platform consistency (Linux/Windows)** | Used CMake and vcpkg to manage platform-specific dependencies. Docker containers ensured build environment consistency.                                                    |
| **Small team size and fast-paced delivery**    | Adopted Agile practices, automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and prioritized modular design to allow parallel development.                                      |
| **Integration between C++ core and UI layers** | Created clean APIs and bindings between C++ engines and QML/.NET frontends using `Q_INVOKABLE`, `Q_PROPERTY`, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.            |
